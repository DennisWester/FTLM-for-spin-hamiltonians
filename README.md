The finite-temperature Lanczos method is a tool for the approximate diagonalisation of hermitian matrices with additional calculation of thermodynamic observables. 
In the programs of this repository, the two opftlm files contain the main routine approximating the magnetisation and susceptibility of complex anisotropic spin hamiltonians.
